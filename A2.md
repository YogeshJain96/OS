# Assignment 2

##### Section A

1.Create directory of your name and then create 4 files inside it named
a.txt, b.txt, c.txt and d.sh. And change the directory permission to
only user and also files permission to only user such that
chmod 400 1			(Making directory 1 as read only)
touch {a..c}.txt d.sh	(creating files in directory)

a)user can read and write the file a.txt and b.txt
```
> chmod 644 a.txt b.txt	(files a.txt and b.txt are have rw permission)	
 or chmod u+rw a.txt b.txt  
```

b)user can write the file c.txt
```
> chmod u+w c.txt 		(file c.txt only write permission) 
or chmod 244 c.txt		
```
c)user can exectuable the file d.sh. Make
Contents of file d.sh:
#/bin/sh
ls -lh
```
> chmod u+x d.sh		(Making file d.sh executable)
   ./b.sh
  (write '!/bin/bash' in file )
```
2.Change the permission of the previous directory to executable only.
Analyze the output.
```
> chmod 100 1 			(Making directory 1 as exucute only)
```
3.Change the permission of the previous directory to read only.
Analyze the output.
```
> chmod 400 1 			(Making directory 1 as read only)
```

4.Use echo to list the all files of your home directory.
```
> echo `ls ~`			(Listing all files of home directory)
```
5.Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory
```
> echo `ls /etc`		(echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory)
```
6.Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory with extension name .conf
```
> echo `ls /etc/*.conf`	(echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory with extension name .conf)
```
7.Use echo to append your name to a.txt
```
> echo "Yogesh" > a.txt	(echo to append your name to a.txt)
```
8.Use echo to list the files of /proc/
```
> echo "`ls /proc/`"		(echo to list the files of /proc/)
```

##### SECTION B
1.Write a program to find sum and product of two no.s using a) expr b) let c) bc
a) 
```
	#!/bin/bash
	echo "Enter two numbers:"
	read num1
	read num2
	sum=`expr $num1 + $num2`
	sub=`expr $num1 - $num2`
	mul=`expr $num1 \* $num2`
	div=`echo " scale=2; $num1/ $num2 " | bc`
	echo "Sum is : $sum"
	echo "diff is : $sub"
	echo "mul is : $mul"
	echo "div is : $div"
```
		OR

```
#!/bin/bash
        echo "Enter two numbers"
        read x
        read y

        echo "x=$x and y=$y"
        sum=`expr $x + $y`       # doing addition
        let "sub = $x - $y";     # doing substraction
        mul=$(($x * $y))         # doing multiplication
        div=`echo "scale=2;$x / $y" | bc` # doing division
        #div=$(($x / $y)) # doing addition
        echo "Sum of $x and $y is $sum"
        echo "Sub of $x and $y is $sub"

div=`echo "scale=6; $x / $y " | bc`
echo "division of two floating nos. is : $div"

```

3.Write a program to print calendar of current month in next year,previous years.
For eg:- sep 2014,sep 2012 if current month is sep 2013
