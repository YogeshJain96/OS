f) display all attributes of files and directories using ls -l
g) display attributes of a directory using ls -ld

2. Create three directory a b and c and create a.txt,b.txt and c.txt
in each directory respectively and then copy c directory into the a.

3. Move Directory b to c.
4 Create alias of ls -lh command to your name.
5 Change Directory name a to cdac.
6 Create five files file1.txt , file2.txt ,file3.txt file4.txt and
file5.txt with some text inside it. Search for &#39;s&#39; character
inside all the files using grep command.
Also Use cat to view all file content together.
7 Create file.txt using cat and edit that using nano editor.
8 Create 5 empty files using touch command.
9 Remove previously created directory a , b and c.

10 Explore the following commands with various options, refer man pages for
further help a) date b) cal c) bc d) echo e) who f) whoami g) logname g) uname h)
seq i) clear

11 Create a file with some content using vi editor
a) Display the file using cat command
b) Display line no.s along with content
c) Display the file in reverse order using tac

d) Combine multiple files using cat command

## Soln:

1.
a) 	ls 		files row wise
	ls -1		files column wise

b)	ls -1 		ascending order
	ls -1 -r	descending order

C) 	mkdir .abc	creating hidden directory
	vi .FileH.txt	creating hidden file
	ls -a		show hidden files

d)	ls -t		show files as latest modified
	ls -rt		show files as reverse of latest modified

e)	ls -R		Display files recursively

f)	ls -l		Display all attributes of files and Directories

g)	ls -ld		Display attributes of current directory

2. 	cp -r c a	copying c directory to a

3.	mv b c		moving(cut) b directory to c

4.	alias yuvi="ls -lh"	creating alias(rename) of the user name

5. 	mv a cdac	changing directory name of 'a' to 'cdac'

6.	grep "s" file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  file4.txt file5.txt
	(searching "s" in all fle mentioned above)
		
	cat *		(view all file contents in a directory)
	cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt

7.	cat>file.txt 	creating a file using cat command
	nano file.txt	editing file.txt using nano editor

8.	touch f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt f5.txt
	(creating empty files using touch cmnd)

9.	rm -rf	abc	Delete the directory

10.	date 		view current date

11.	
a) cat *			(Display all files together)
b) cat -n * || :set nu		(Display file contents with line no.)
c) tac *			(Display fileconten in reversing order linewise)
d) cat file1.txt file2.txt > filecombine.txt	(combine multiple file)
