1.Write a script to perform the following:

a) To count no.of processes which are running or ready in the system (Hint:- ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd,stat, grep )

> ps -e | wc -l

b) List out foreground processes running in the system (ps suffix + in the state for
the foreground processes)

> ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd,stat | grep -e +

c) List out all processes whose parent is init

> ps -e -o ppid | grep '^  *0$'

2.WRITE A MENU BASED SCRIPT TO PERFORM FOLLOWING STRING OPERATIONS
A) TO FIND LENGTH OF A STRING
C) COPYING STRING
D) CONCATENATION OF STRINGS
E) COMPARISON OF TWO STRINGS
F) REVERSING A STRING
```

echo "0) Exit"

echo "Enter Choice"
read ch
while [ ch!=0 ]
do
case $ch in
	1)echo "Enter String"
	  	read str
		echo "Length of the $str is ${#str}";;
	2)echo "Enter String1"
	  	read str1
	  	str2=$str1
		echo "Copy of $str1 is $str2";;
	3)echo "Enter String1"
	  	read str1
	  	echo "Enter String2"
	  	read str2
	  	str3=$str1$str2
		echo "After concat of $str1 and $str2 is $str3";;
	4)echo "Enter String1"

	  	if [ $str1 \< $str2 ]
	  	then 
	  	echo "$str2 is greater than $str1"
	    else

	5)echo "Enter String"
	  	read str
	  	echo "Reverse of $str is " 
	  	echo $str | rev
	  ;;
	*)exit
esac
echo "Enter Choice"
read ch
done
```
3.WRITE A SCRIPT TO CHECK WHETHER GIVEN ARGUMENT IS A REGULAR FILE OR DIRECTORY
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Check file or directory"

echo "Enter File or Directory Name"
read fd

if [[ -d $fd ]]
then
echo "$fd is Directory!"
elif [[ -f $fd ]]
then
echo "$fd is file!"
else
echo "$fd is invalid!"
fi
```
4.TO CHECK GIVEN YEAR IS LEAP OR NOT
```
#!bin/bash
echo "Check for leap Year"
echo "Enter a year"
read year

#leap logic

n400=$(($year%400))
n100=$(($year%100))
n4=$(($year%4))
echo $n

	  	if [ $n400 \< 1 ]
	  	then 
	  		echo "$year is a leap year"
	    elif [ $n100 \< 1 ]
	  	then 
	  		echo "$year is not a leap year"
	  	elif [ $n4 \< 1 ]
	  	then 
	  		echo "$year is a leap year"
	    else
	    	echo "$year is not a leap year"
	    fi
```
5.WRITE A SCRIPT TO CREATE 10 DIRECTORIES, SAY EXAM1,EXAM2,...,EXAM10 
REPORT ERROR IF A DIRECTORY/FILE EXISTS WITH SAME NAME.
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "creating 10 directories"
n=1;
while [ $n -le 10 ]
do
dirname=exam$n
echo "Creating $dirname"
if [[ -d $dirname ]]
then
echo "$dirname Exists"
else
mkdir -p $dirname
fi
n=$(($n+1))
done
echo "Enter Dir Name"
read d
if [[ -d $d ]]
then
echo "$d Exists"
else
echo "$d Not Exists"
fi
```
6.WRITE A SCRIPT TO CHECK EACH ENTRY OF A DIRECTORY IS A FILE OR DIRECTORY.
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Check file or directory"

echo "Enter File or Directory Name"
read fd

if [[ -d $fd ]]
then
echo "$fd is Directory!"
elif [[ -f $fd ]]
then
echo "$fd is file!"
else
echo "$fd is invalid!"
fi
```
